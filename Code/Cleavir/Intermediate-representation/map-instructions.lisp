;;; Function MAP-INSTRUCTIONS.
;;;
;;; Call FUNCTION on each instruction of an instruction graph the root
;;; of which is INITIAL-INSTRUCTION.  In this version of the mapping
;;; function, we traverse the instruction graph depth-first, and we
;;; make sure that FUNCTION is called on every instruction of a
;;; particular function before it is called on the instructions of
;;; any nested functions.
;;;
;;; We traverse the graph by using an explicit stack (in the form of
;;; an ordinary list) of instruction to process, rather than using the
;;; control stack in a recursive traversal function.  The reason for
;;; doing it this way is that the control stack of many
;;; implementations can be relatively small, and if the instruction
;;; graph is big, then the control stack can easily be exhausted.

;;;
;;; Function MAP-INSTRUCTIONS-WITH-OWNER.
;;;
;;; In this variation of MAP-INSTRUCTIONS, FUNCTION is called with two
;;; arguments, namely the instruction and the owner of the
;;; instruction.
;;;
;;; Why is this important, one might ask?  Well, it can be used
;;; to compute ownership of DATA.  Recall that the owner of a datum is
;;; the MOST SENIOR (in terms of the PARENT relationship) of the
;;; owners of the instructions that refer to it.  So we can compute
;;; the ownership of DATA by traversing the instructions with this
;;; function, attributing an owner to the data used by an instruction
;;; only if no owner has previously been attributed.
;;;
;;; The internal logic is essentially identical to that of MAP-INSTRUCTIONS,
;;; but we track the "current owner" as well. Because enclose CODEs are
;;; added to the end of the worklist, we can just do one entire function at
;;; a time, tracking one owner.
